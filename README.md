# Project--Creating-First-Smart-Contract

<table>
  
**In this project We will build our First Smart Contract on Ethereum Block** <br></br>

**We are gonna visualize our Smart Contract and all the functionalities using Truffle Ganache**<br></br>

**Before jumping to the code lets understand Blockchain, Ethereum, Truffle Ganache and Smart Contract First**...<br></br>

**What is Blockchain**?<br></br>
A blockchain is a distributed database or ledger shared among a computer network's nodes. They are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions, but they are not limited to cryptocurrency uses. Blockchains can be used to make data in any industry immutable‚Äîthe term used to describe the inability to be altered.<br></br>

Because there is no way to change a block, the only trust needed is at the point where a user or program enters data. This aspect reduces the need for trusted third parties, which are usually auditors or other humans that add costs and make mistakes.Since Bitcoin's introduction in 2009, blockchain uses have exploded via the creation of various cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and smart contracts.<br></br>

Blockchain is a type of shared database that differs from a typical database in the way it stores information; blockchains store data in blocks linked together via cryptography.Different types of information can be stored on a blockchain, but the most common use for transactions has been as a ledger.<br></br>
In Bitcoin‚Äôs case, blockchain is decentralized so that no single person or group has control‚Äîinstead, all users collectively retain control.
Decentralized blockchains are immutable, which means that the data entered is irreversible. For Bitcoin, transactions are permanently recorded and viewable to anyone.<br></br>


**What is Ethereum?** <br></br>

Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain with smart contract functionality. Ether is the native cryptocurrency of the platform. Among cryptocurrencies, ether is second only to bitcoin in market capitalization. It is open-source software. Ethereum was conceived in 2013 by programmer Vitalik Buterin.Ethereum is a technology that's home to digital money, global payments, and applications. The community has built a booming digital economy, bold new ways for creators to earn online, and so much more. It's open to everyone, wherever you are in the world ‚Äì all you need is the internet<br></br>
